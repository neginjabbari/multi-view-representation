# Multi-view Representation Learning and Clustering (Python)

This repository provides **Python (Jupyter Notebook) implementations** of multiple **multi-view representation learning** and **multi-view clustering** methods, with a strong focus on **Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**–based approaches.

The code is intended for **research and academic use**, enabling reproducibility, comparison, and extension of existing methods.
